## Summary

<!-- What changed and why, in two or three sentences. -->

## 3-factor

<!-- Every change considers all three (owner decision 3 Nov). Keep the three rows. -->

| | What changes | Files |
|---|---|---|
| Web | | |
| iOS | | |
| Shared rule | | |

## Owner decisions

<!-- Every project-planner-web docs/OWNER_DECISIONS.md row this work implements or touches: ✓ done / ✗ not done. List judgement calls for the owner to confirm. -->

| Date | Decision (row) | Status in this PR |
|---|---|---|
| | | |

## Call sites

<!-- Both repos. Search by function name and by concept (feature-completeness.md step 1). -->

| Path | Rulebook function ✓ / own calculation ✗ (fixed here / follow-up) |
|---|---|
| | |

## Ways in checked

<!-- Every link, button, notification, Home tile and deep link that opens the screen, on web and iOS (step 2). -->

## Screen map rows updated

<!-- project-planner-web docs/SCREEN_MAP.md rows this PR affects (the web map is updated in the web repo), or "none (no screen touched)". -->

## Deploy needed

<!-- firestore.rules / storage.rules / firestore.indexes.json / which Cloud Functions, with the exact commands — or "nothing to deploy". -->

## minimumIosBuild needed

<!-- yes / no, and why (project-planner-web docs/agent-rules/platform-guardrails.md §4: pay, hours or who may write a document). -->

## Not done / follow-ups

<!-- Every finding not fixed here (step 5). "Out of scope" is fine; "not mentioned" is not. -->

## What I did NOT check

<!-- No browser run, no device build, no production data, emulator only… -->
